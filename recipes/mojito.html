<center><p><em>The mojito is the epitome of the refreshing cocktail, stripped down to just the bare essentials of rum, lime juice, sugar, soda water, and mint. Each ingredient is seemingly specifically selected to cure hot weather-induced pangs
     of thirst â€” it is in turns sweet, acidic, minty, and sparkling.</em></p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3></center>
<p><ul>
    <li>
        Fresh mint sprigs  
    </li> 
    <li>2 Limes</li>
    <li>
        Ice
    </li>
    <li>
        High quality rum
    </li>
    <li>
        Agave or simple syrup
    </li>
    <li>
        Sparkling lime flavored water or mineral water
    </li>
</ul></p>



<center><h3>Let's begin!</h3></center>
<p><ol>
<li>Start by muddling the mint. You can use whatever you have on hand to press down and gently move side to side. Do not over muddle
     this can make the drink taste a little bland. A gentle muddle will do.</li>
<li>
    Drop the mint on the bottom of your glass. Fill the glass
     will a few slices of lime and then fill the cup up almost
      to the rim with ice. </li>
<li>Pour the agave, lime juice, and rum in the cup. Then pour the sparkling water until the glass is full. Add more mint to the top and give it a good stir. The liquor
 and agave tend to sink and need to be mixed up a bit. Enjoy ice cold!
</li>
