<p><em>Our all time specialities Beef 
    pepperoni loaded on a tomato base 
    and topped with melting mozzarella cheese</em></p>
<h3>Ingredients utilised for the creation of the delicacy below:</h3>
</center>
<p><ul>
<li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
<li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
<li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
<li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade </li>

</ul></p>
<center><h3>Let's begin!</h3></center>
<p><ol>

    <li>Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone,
     preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes 
     so it is nice and hot as well.</li>
<li>If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza.
     You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.</li>
     <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large pizza,
 I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</li>
 <li>Transfer the dough to a
 lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit it into a large cast-iron</li>
 <li>Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with
      grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.</li>
<li>If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes,
     or until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.</li>
<li>If you're using a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add toppings. Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500
     ̊F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
<li>Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces.
     Season with fresh oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.</li>
<li>Stir together the
 softened butter and honey, then serve alongside the pizza for crust dipping.</li>
 <br>
 <em>Store leftover pizza in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat pizza in a sturdy skillet over medium heat with a drizzle of oil. Cover skillet
    with a lid and cook until the cheese has melted and crust is crispy.</em>
